# PEMODELAN dan SIMULASI DATA
It is a 6th semester course at the University of Muhammadiyah Malang. At the end of this semester, assigned to make a final project based on the material that has been studied. Our group chose the classification material, which in our opinion this image classification is quite easy to complete in order to fulfill the final semester assignment. The topic we chose was related to "Classification Face Mask Detection Using Mask and Without Mask".

## About Dataset 
In compiling this project using datasets obtained from (Github.com)[https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiments/dest_folder] and (Kaggle.com)[https://www.kaggle .com/omkargurav/face-mask-dataset] . This dataset is used for Classification of Face Mask Detection with images consisting of approximately 8929 images. After getting the dataset, we divide into 3 values from the raw dataset into 3 types of trains with 80% while Test 10% and Validation 10%. With directory details:
  1. Test :
     * WithMask : 442 images
     * WithoutMask : 452 images
  2. Train :
     * WithMask : 3532 images
     * WithoutMask : 3611 images
  3. Validation :
     * WithMask : 441 images
     * WithoutMask : 451 images
  
## About Project
This study discusses the classification of facial images using masks and not using masks. This study develops previous research in major journal references by using a similar dataset but applying a different proposed method, namely using the transfer learning method with a pre-trained DensNet model architecture for the classification of facial images using masks and not using masks with accuracy and value values. evaluation which has increased compared to the previous method.
