# PEMODELAN dan SIMULASI DATA
It is a 6th semester course at the University of Muhammadiyah Malang. At the end of this semester, assigned to make a final project based on the material that has been studied. Our group chose the classification material, which in our opinion this image classification is quite easy to complete in order to fulfill the final semester assignment. The topic we chose was related to "Classification Face Mask Detection Using Mask and Without Mask".

## About Dataset 
In compiling this project using a dataset obtained from [Github.com]([https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree/master/experiments/dest_folder](https://github.com/prajnasb/observations/tree /master/experiments/data)). This dataset is used for Face Mask Detection Classification with images consisting of approximately 1300 images. After getting the dataset, we divide into 3 values from the raw dataset into 3 types of train with 80% while Test is 10% and Validation is 10%. With directory details:
  1. Test :
     * WithMask : 69 images
     * WithoutMask : 69 images
  2. Train :
     * WithMask : 552 images
     * WithoutMask : 548 images
  3. Validation :
     * WithMask : 69 images
     * WithoutMask : 69 images
  
## About Project
This study discusses the classification of facial images using masks and not using masks. This study develops previous research in major journal references by using a similar dataset but applying a different proposed method, namely using the transfer learning method with a pre-trained DensNet model architecture for the classification of facial images using masks and not using masks with accuracy and value values. evaluation which has increased compared to the previous method.
